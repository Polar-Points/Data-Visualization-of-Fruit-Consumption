	This is a interactive recreation of Professor Nelson's Expenditure-Income graph, 
	where cumulative income share is shown on the x-axis, and cumulative expenditure
	of organic fruits share is on the y-axis. As both of these values are market shares, 
	their values are maximally one and minimally zero. The drop down menu allows for 
	users to choose a market region they want to investigate. The home button allows 
	them to return to the original multiline graph. 
      </p>

      <p style="text-align:justify">
	The 45-degree line is supposed to show what happens in the relationship between consumption
	and income when each income group spends the exact same amount on a type of organic fruit.
	The curve lines display the actual relationship between these two variables in a specific
	market region.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align:justify">
	An example of how to interprete the graph: Louieville's expenditure/income line follows
	the 45-degree line quite closely, which means that in this region, each income group spends 
	relatively the same amount of money on organic fruits. However, Jacksonville's line arcs
	up and away from the 45-degree line at first, and level out when income increases. This
	demonstrates that people in the low and middle income brackets actually occupies a bigger
	share of the total's expenditure on organic fruits than those in the upper income brackets. 
	To put it more simply and crudely, in Jacksonville, the poorer and middle classes spend more
	on organic fruit than the upper class.
